## Hello there! 

#### My name is Reece. I'm a programmer with experience in software dev, database management, web dev, and game dev. With that in mind, my expertise lies in C#, C++, Unity, Unreal Engine 5, SQL, .NET Development (using ASP and MAUI), though given the aforementioned varied experience I have across most sectors of development, I am quite versatile with various languages and tools and can easily pick up new tools very quickly and easily.

#### For work, I've developed CLIs, games, APIs, web applications, and assisted with the error handling and validation of an internal R package. Outside of work, I like to work on personal projects (mostly game dev, but I like to develop some non-games projects every so often just to do something different) to keep my skills sharp and try out new tools, programming languages, and programming design patterns.
